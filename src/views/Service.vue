              There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service,
              to third-party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or
              features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party
              content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also
              permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including
              applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party
              web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to
              share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly
              posted on that third party’s service or application. Using this functionality typically
              requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own
              risk. Sightour does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their
              content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Sightour is in no way responsible or
              liable for any such third-party services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS
              DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD
              PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications
              that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service
              (each, an “Application”) and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or
              pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge
              and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are
              consenting to information about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of
              an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or
              associated with you, even if Sightour has not itself provided such information; and (iii)
              your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the Sightour
              Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service
              via automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may
              be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine
              with Sightour’s express consent).
            </li>
            Rights
            <li>
              Sightour does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service.
              Instead, you hereby grant to Sightour a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free,
              transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or
              through the Service, subject to the Service’s Privacy Policy, available here

              information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

              Note about “Invite Friends” feature: If you choose to invite someone to the Service through
              our “Invite friends” feature, you may select a person from a friend contacts list through
              thrid-party social media site. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any
              charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is
              coming directly from your personal account, Sightour does not have access to or control
              this communication.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements
              and promotions, and you hereby agree that Sightour may place such advertising and promotions
              on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent
              of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial
              communications as such.
            </li>
            <li>
              You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service
              or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Service;
              (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate
              or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights,
              publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights;
              (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you
              post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these
              Terms of Service in your jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Service contains content owned or licensed by Sightour (“Sightour Content”). Sightour Content
              is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and
              Sightour, Sightour owns and retains all rights in the Sightour Content and the Service. You will
              not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights
              notices incorporated in or accompanying the Sightour Content and you will not reproduce, modify,
              adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit,
              broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Sightour Content.
            </li>
            <li>
              The OmiCam name and logo are trademarks of Sightour, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in
              whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Sightour. In addition, all page headers,
              custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of
              Sightour, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written
              permission from Sightour.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although it is Sightour’s intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will
              be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance
              or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment.
              Also, Sightour reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice.
              Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Sightour, including, without limitation,
              in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order.
              Consequently, Sightour encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content.
              In other words, Sightout is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for
              the purposes of Content backup or storage. Sightour will not be liable to you for any modification,
              suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the
              Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may
              not be secure.
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree that Sightour is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within
              the Service. Sightour does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any
              Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Service, you may bear legal responsibility for
              that Content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Except as otherwise described in the Service’s Privacy Policy, as between you and Sightour,
              any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use
              or disclosure of Content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Sightour is not
              a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to
              submit any Content does not place Sightour in a position that is any different from the position
              held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content
              will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Sightour, and Sightour will not
              be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is Sightout’s policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or
              other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific
              terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your
              ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly,
              Sightour does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any
              materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content,
              information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Sightour is free to
              use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes
              whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services,
              without any liability or payment of any kind to you.

              We respect other people’s rights, and expect you to do the same.

            <li>
              When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,
              collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.”
              Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with
              your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data
              stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s
              operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by OmiCam.
            </li>
            <li>
              A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you
              browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content
              and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of
              device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
            </li>
            Metadata:
            <li>
              Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example,
              Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and
              how that content is formatted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag
              (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to
              a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others
              and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other’s APIs then,
              your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a
              location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy
              settings.

            <strong>Entire Agreement</strong> If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that
            you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of
            Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Sightour and governs your use of the
            Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Sightour. You will not assign the
            Terms of Service or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in
            part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of OmiCam.
            Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of
            OmiCam will be null and void. Sightour may assign these Terms of Service or any rights hereunder
            without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent
            jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such
            portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Service and will not affect the validity
            and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of
            Service remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor
            trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Service. These Terms of Service do not confer any
            third-party beneficiary rights.Territorial Restrictions The information provided within the
            Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction
            or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would
            subject OmiCam to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve
            the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person,
            geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the
            quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that OmiCam provides.
