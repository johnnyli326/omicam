          Welcome to OmiCam (“OmiCam,” “we,” “us” or “our”).
					OmiCam is a APP designed for OmiCam wearable VR camera.
					We will help you to transcode the original photos/videos
					taken by camera into a panoramaic format. Also we provide
					the post-editing function to help me integrate multiple panoramic
					photos/videos as a one personalized panoramic story. You could use
					it to share with your friends on the social media and have the immersive
					experience for each of your adventure. 1. Our Privacy Policy explains how
					we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile
					services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with
					OmiCam services (collectively, the “Service”), and your choices about
					the collection and use of your information. 2. By using our Service you
					understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post
					content, including photos, comments and other materials (“User Content”),
					to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other
					Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that
					you make publicly available through the Service,3. Our Policy applies

								of the Service.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h5 class="my-2">Device identifiers:</h5>
            <ul class="p-0">

								When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,
								collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.”
								Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with
								your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data
								stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s
								operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by OmiCam.

                Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark
								keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other
								data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your
								photo or tag your photo using other’s APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the
								photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you
								in accordance with your privacy settings.
